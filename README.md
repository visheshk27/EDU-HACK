Read Aloud is a terminal-based ebook reader that renders a book in a multi-column layout with margins, page numbers, and justified text. It is not currently considered finished but in its current form it supports plain-text ebooks (such as can be downloaded off Project Gutenberg) and bookmarks to save your place.

USAGE:- "book.py ebook.txt"
